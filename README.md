# word-day-scheduler

##Description

Allows user to input entries into a work day schedule. 

When they click save their entry is stored in local storage so they can still read the schedule after leaving or refreshing the page.

Added a button to clear the inputs.

Schedule also changes color dynamically depending on the hour of the day.

Previous hours are greyed out, future hours are colored gree, and the current hour is red.


##Build With:

Javascript
BootStrap
